          Nigerian cuisine consists of dishes from hundreds of ethnic group that
        comprise Nigeria. I would be offering different cuisines on my website but my main focus would be on
        Nigerian foods.
           Nigerian foods cater for any kind of persons no matter what your palate may be. If you are
        non-vegetarian, there are so many foods to pick from the different ethnic groups in the
        country and different way to prepare it. For a vegetarian, there are surprisingly many dishes
        that are made with beans, vegetables, and other plant-based ingredients which our website
        would talk about. Nigerian cuisine also consists of a lot of hot peppers and spices.
           Vegetables are the best things we can eat for our bodies and overall wellbeing. Nigeria is a West African country with a vast variety of ethnic communities as well as a wide variety of rich culinary traditions. 
        While Nigerians have a great love for meat and fish, there are great Nigerian vegetarian foods that you might want to try. 
        Whether you’re curious about healthy Nigerian dishes or looking to eat tasty vegetarian foods more this year. For Example is Jollof Rice. 
            The most commonly know Nigerian food is jollof rice. Spiced and stewed in a flavorful tomato broth, it is everything from "everyday" to celebration. The classic version is cooked with long-grain rice (Uncle Ben's/Carolina's) and seasoned with Nigerian-style curry powder and dried thyme. Served with fried, ripe plantains which we call dodo and coleslaw, it is everything. There is a strong community of Nigerans living in the city who would want to have a taste of
        home and who would like to see what we have to offer to satisfy their carvings
        each day.
            Efo riro (Nigerian Spinach Stew) is a mouthwatering, savory, African stew made with spinach and is oh so flavorful! Who knew spinach could taste so good? Raise your hands if you loved your leafy greens as a kid! Nope, that wasn’t me. Just trying to get my vegetables in was like a punishment to me. Not like I had a choice, my mama don’t play! Efo Riro is a Yoruba word and it loosely means ‘stirred spinach’. In Nigeria, the vegetables used for Efo Riro are 'Efo Shoko' (Lagos spinach) or 'Efo Tete' (African spinach).

            These are the local spinach varieties that are very popular and easily available. In other parts of the world, any spinach greens will do.

            Nigerian food is a rich African cuisine that you should try. The tasty Nigerian vegetarian foods are a must-try due to their rich, diverse flavors. The wide variety of vegetables, spices, and other ingredients such as beans, and yam among others, give these dishes a unique and tasty appeal.
